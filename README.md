# Deep-Stats-Soccer-Player-Valuation
Using Deep Stats and TransferMarkt data to build interpretable player valuation models

# Data
The data used in this project came from two key sources:
1. Market value and age data from TransferMark (https://www.transfermarkt.us/)
2. Player performance data from Understat (https://understat.com/)

Data was collected for all players who played in at least one of the top 5 leagues in the 2020-2021 season. For reference, these leagues are:
1. English Premier League
2. Italian Serie A
3. German Bundesliga
4. Spanish La Liga
5. French Ligue 1

The data files that include player performance, age, and TransferMarkt value for players in each of these leagues in the 2020-2021 season can be found in the Data directory in this repository. 

# Code
The SoccerAnalysisGit.py file is your one-stop shop for all the code I used to perform the data analysis in this project.
